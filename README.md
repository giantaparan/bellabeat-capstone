# Purpose

Last Updated on February 26, 2024.

This is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Course on Coursera. In this largely self-guided and independent project, I analyzed [fitness and exercise data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?resource=download "Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data") from 30 Fitbit users as well as [survey responses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitaaswani/fitness-consumer-survey-data "Fitness Consumer Survey Data") from another set of 30 fitness wearable users, analyzed trends found within the data, created visualizations to show these trends, and provided high-level recommendations and insights. The company involved in the project is Bellabeat, a company that manufactures health-focused products for women.

This repository contains all materials used in this project. Included here you will find a presentation deliverable containing data documentation, a summary of the analysis of the data, several data visualizations, and a few recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

Other deliverables include all SQL queries written and used in the project, a PDF containing full data documentation of the cleaning and manipulation of the datasets, and all the final data tables in CSV form used for analysis.
